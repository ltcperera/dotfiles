# Terminal Multiplexer Setup

This custom tmux setup uses TPM as the plugin manager. TPM is already added as
a submodule, so all thats needed are the following steps to get things setup.

1. Start tmux session:

```
tmux
```

2. Hit the ` + I key to install the plugins.

You should see confirmation that plugins were installed.
