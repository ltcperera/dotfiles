## Terminal Multiplexer Setup

This is my tmux setup with customizations that I use for development at the terminal. Steps to get this setup are as follows:

1. Clone the Tmux Plugin Manager as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.config/tmux/plugins/tpm
```

2. Start tmux session:

```
tmux
```

3. Hit the ` + I key to install the plugins.
